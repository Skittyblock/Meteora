# Meteora
Meteora is a tweak to completly bring back the iOS 9 lockscreen to iOS 10+    
Currently it is a work in progress. Once this project is completed it will be released on BigBoss as a paid package.    
This tweak was mainly created by iKilledAppl3 but he open sourced it hoping someone would help fix the bugs. I (Skittyblock) decided to help so he could release it. Most things done in this tweak were originally written by iKilledAppl3.    

# Things to Do!
- Notifications: The Notifications are only half completed. Regular notifications don't appear.
- Prevent the lockscreen from relocking itself when you tap on a notification in the NC, tap to open the Music application on the Lockscreen (from the Control Center).
- Fix other bugs (yes there's lots more)
