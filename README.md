# Meteora
Meteora is a tweak to completly bring back the iOS 9 lockscreen to iOS 10+    
Currently it is a work in progress. Once this project is completed it will be released on BigBoss as a paid package.    
This tweak was mainly created by iKilledAppl3 but he open sourced it hoping someone would help fix the bugs. Skitty decided to help so iKilledAppl3 could release it. Most credit iKilledAppl3 to him for originally creating the tweak and figuring everything out.    

# Things to Do!
- Notifications: The Notifications are only half completed. Regular notifications don't appear.    
- Slide to unlock text: Changing it currently doesn't work yet.
- Fix more bugs: Yeah, there's lots more bugs we know.
